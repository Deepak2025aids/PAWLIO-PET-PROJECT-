# Pawlio — Pet Adoption Project

This is the Pawlio pet adoption front-end project. It is a single-file HTML/CSS/JavaScript site (`index.html`) with local asset folders under `assets/`.

Quick start
- Open `index.html` in a browser (no build step required).
- Use the login panel to access gated content and the Adopt section.

Notes
- Asset paths are relative to the project root (e.g. `assets/Bruno/bruno.jpg`).
- Video placeholders are included; replace them with real `.mp4` files if desired.

Contributing
- If you want me to add GitHub Pages hosting or a short CI workflow, tell me and I can add it.
